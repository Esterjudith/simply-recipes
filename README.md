How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In this project I used vanilla CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I organized the colors, shades, grays, etc with CSS variables this was very useful in keeping the website consistent through out all the webpages. Each image in the home page links to the recipe which also includes tags where you can see similar recipes.

Lessons Learned:
Variables in CSS can really help in speed and cohesiveness of the code and website, one this that I found interesting was how adding @media querie at the end of each end of a "part" of the website instead of at the end of the css code was interesting it really helps in minimazing how much info is going to be actually needed in the media queries.
